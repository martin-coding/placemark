# placemark

Hapi web app to view information about point of interests.

# Overview

This application allows users to save and manage points of interest (POIs) by adding them to a list with coordinates and descriptions. Built with Hapi.js for the backend, it helps travelers, tourists, and explorers save and organize places they find interesting.

# Usage

## API Documentation

To explore the API endpoints, visit `/documentation` in your browser. This will open the Swagger UI, where you can view and interact with all available API routes.

### Example

- Run your server locally (or access the deployed version). TODO
- Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:PORT/documentation`.

This will display a fully interactive Swagger UI, allowing you to test API requests directly from the documentation.
